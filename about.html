                    <p>
                        <em>7</em> is our seventh full-length record. At its release, we will have been a band for
                        over 13
                        years. We have
                        now written and released a total of <em>77</em> songs together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last year, we released an album of b-sides and rarities. It felt like a good step for us. It
                        helped us clean the
                        creative closet, put the past to bed, and start anew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the process of recording <em>7</em>, our goal was rebirth and rejuvenation. We wanted
                        to rethink old
                        methods and shed some self-imposed limitations. In the past, we often limited our writing to
                        parts that we could
                        perform live. On <em>7</em>, we decided to follow whatever came naturally. As a result, there
                        are some songs with
                        no guitar, and some without keyboard. There are songs with layers and production that we could
                        never recreate live,
                        and that is exciting to us. Basically, we let our creative moods, instead of instrumentation,
                        dictate the album’s
                        feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the past, the economics of recording have dictated that we write for a year, go to the
                        studio, and record the
                        entire record as quickly as possible. We have always hated this because by the time the
                        recording happens, a certain
                        excitement about older songs has often been lost. This time, we built a "home" studio, and began
                        all of the songs
                        there. Whenever we had a group of 3-4 songs that we were excited about, we would go to a
                        “proper” recording studio
                        and finish recording them there. This way, the amount of time between the original idea and the
                        finished song was
                        pretty short (of the album’s 11 songs, 8 were finished at Carriage House in Stamford, CT and 2
                        at Palmetto Studio
                        in Los Angeles).
                    </p>
                    <p class="more-cont" style="display:none;">
                        <em>7</em> didn’t have a producer in the traditional sense. We much preferred this, as
                        it felt like the
                        ideas drove the creativity, not any one person’s process. James Barone, who became our live
                        drummer in 2016, played on the entire record. His tastes and the trust we have in him really
                        helped us keep rhythm at the center of a lot of these songs. We also worked with Sonic Boom
                        (Peter Kember). Peter became a great force on this record, in the shedding of conventions and in
                        helping to keep the songs alive, fresh and protected from the destructive forces of recording
                        studio over-production/over-perfection.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more-cont" style="display:none;">
                        The societal insanity of 2016-17 was also deeply influential, as it must be for most artists
                        these days. Looking back, there is
                        quite a bit of chaos happening in these songs, and a pervasive dark field that we had little
                        control over. The discussions
                        surrounding women’s issues were a constant source of inspiration and questioning. The energy,
                        lyrics and moods of much of this
                        record grew from ruminations on the roles, pressures and conditions that our society places on
                        women, past and present.
                        The twisted double edge of glamour, with its perils and perfect moments, was an endless source
                        (see “L’Inconnue,” “Drunk in LA,”
                        “Woo,” “Girl Of The Year,” “Last Ride”).
                    </p>
                    <p class="more-cont" style="display:none;">
                        In a more general sense, we are interested by the human mind's (and nature’s) tendency to create
                        forces equal and opposite to
                        those present. Thematically, this record often deals with the beauty that arises in dealing with
                        darkness; the empathy and love
                        that grows from collective trauma; the place one reaches when they accept rather than deny (see
                        “Dark Spring,” “Pay No Mind,”
                        “Lemon Glow,” “Dive,” “Black Car,” “Lose Your Smile”).
                    </p>
                    <p class="more-cont" style="display:none;">
                        The title, <em>7</em>, itself is simply a number that represents our seventh record. We hoped
                        its simplicity would encourage people to look
                        inside. No title using words that we could find felt like an appropriate summation of the album.
                    </p>
                    <p class="more-cont" style="display:none;">
                        The number <em>7</em> does represent some interesting connections in numerology. 1 and 7 have
                        always shared a common look, so <em>7</em> feels like
                        the perfect step in the sequence to act as a restart or “semi-first.” Most early religions also
                        had a fascination with <em>7</em> as being
                        the highest level of spirituality, as in "Seventh Heaven.” At our best creative moments, we felt
                        we were channeling some kind of
                        heavy truth, and we sincerely hope the listeners will feel that.
